* Game idea

Tritops is some sort of a breakout style game.  It shows a equilateral triangle
in the center which the user is able to turn left and right.

The triangle ia surrounded by arcs of different legths.  These are colored differently.

The goal of the game is to remove all arcs.

The mechanics are such that the ball:
- deflects from the triangle's sides
